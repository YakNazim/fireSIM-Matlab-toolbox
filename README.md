# Overview : 
fireSIM Toolbox features empricial models for hydrocarbon fire modelization. 

It includes 4 applications, each for a specific phenomenon : pool fires, fireballs, jetfires, and gas outflows, with consideration to ambiant conditions...

# Featured models  : 
**Pool fires** : Solid flame model, Mudan, Zabetakis-Burgess ...

**Fireball** : Solid flame, TNO 

**Jet fire** : SHELL-Chamberlain, 

# Features
**Pool fires** : flame length & tilt, burning rate, heatflux over distance (1D & 2D* ), thermal effects - probabilities of death or injury, estimated number of injuries/death in the area

**Fireball** : fireball geometrical properties, burning rate, heatflux over distance (1D & 2D* ), thermal effects - probabilities of death or injury, estimated number of injuries/death in the area

**Jet fires** : Geometrical properties, flow properties, heatflux over distance, thermal effects - probabilities of death or injury. 

**Gas outflow** :  Outflow from tanks/vessels : evolution of  flowrate, pressure, and other properties over time. 

*only in no wind conditions.
